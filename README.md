# Example React ToDo App #4,619,432,286,113
## There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Example ToDo list app built with vanilla React + Vite.

## Notes
Doing super generic setup. Using single controlled input with a button for adding new tasks; added keyup listener to "submit" on hitting Enter key so it works like a proper form.
